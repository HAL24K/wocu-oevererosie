The sample data files (`sample_data_*.geojson`) were created by getting the updated
data_collector_around_fake_eroded_bank in tests, bumping its buffer to 5_000m and running the relevant to_crs calls.
The data included is the same.

The test_prediction_regions.geojson are two randomly selected regions from Luke's initial data geopackage, from
the layer `vlakken_scope`.

The river centerline is taken directly from data provided by Etienne, simplified with a 20m tolerance
(shrinks the file from 1.4MB to 29kB).

The rover_bank_points.geojson contains real data for AND 3 and 5; for the later AHN we simply generated data
by shifting each AHN point in a random direction by 1m sequentially one fake AHN at a time. NOTE: this might have
moved some points outside their region ID, that's for later to deal with if need be.
